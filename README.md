**Extended Key Promoter X IntelliJ plugin**

Any time you miss the shortcut, you're not only getting the notification telling you which keyboard shortcut you should have used insted, but also the sound notifications! This is meant to irritate you to the point where you either start using the keyboard shortcuts (yaaay!), or @#$%&, disable the plugin, and never touch it again :)

Depending on how hard you're trying NOT to improve, you will need to deal with a noisy duck, annoying buzzer or falling Mario :)
